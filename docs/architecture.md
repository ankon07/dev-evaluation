# Developer Evaluation and Reward System Architecture

## System Overview

This system automatically evaluates developer performance based on quantifiable and qualitative metrics from GitHub, task management systems, CI/CD pipelines, and code quality tools. Developers are rewarded with blockchain tokens for completing tasks, achieving milestones, contributing to code quality, and collaborating effectively.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI
- **Blockchain**: Polygon (Ethereum L2 solution)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (ERC-20 token standard)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **APIs Integration**: GitHub API, Jilo API, CI/CD tools API, SonarQube API
- **Oracle Solution**: Chainlink for secure data feeds

## Core Components

### 1. Data Integration Module
- GitHub API connector
- Jilo-like task management system connector
- CI/CD tools connector (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- Code quality tools connector (SonarQube)
- Knowledge sharing platforms connector (optional)

### 2. Evaluation Engine
- Task completion evaluator
- Code quality analyzer
- Collaboration metrics calculator
- Skill identification system
- Token reward calculator

### 3. Blockchain & Token Module
- ERC-20 token smart contract
- Oracle integration for secure data feeds
- Token minting, transfer, and burning mechanisms
- Staking and vesting functionality (optional)

### 4. Developer Wallet & Interface
- Performance dashboard
- Token balance and transaction history
- Achievements and gamification elements
- Skill profile visualization
- Peer bonus feature (optional)

### 5. Admin & HR Integration Module
- System configuration interface
- Reward rules management
- Monitoring and analytics dashboard
- HR data export functionality
- Audit logging system

## Data Flow

1. Data is collected from various platforms (GitHub, Jilo, CI/CD, code quality tools)
2. The evaluation engine processes the data and calculates performance metrics
3. Performance metrics are translated into token rewards
4. The oracle securely triggers smart contract functions to mint and transfer tokens
5. Developers can view their performance, token balance, and achievements through the dashboard
6. Administrators can configure the system, manage reward rules, and export data for HR processes

## Security Considerations

- All API credentials are securely stored and encrypted
- Smart contracts undergo thorough auditing
- Oracle mechanisms are secured against manipulation
- Comprehensive audit logging for all system actions
- Role-based access control for administrative functions
